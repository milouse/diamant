Diamant is a server for the [[https://gemini.circumlunar.space/][Gemini network protocol]], built in Ruby. Diamant
has very few features, and can only serve static files.

Internally, it uses the OpenSSL library to handle the TLS sessions, and the
Ruby ~Thread~ implementation to handle concurrent requests.

* Installation and setup

Diamant is a [[https://rubygems.org/][Ruby gem]]. You need a working Ruby environment to use it. We
recommand you to use [[https://rvm.io][RVM]] and a specific gemset. However it will works with a
global ruby installation too.

#+begin_src shell
  rvm get latest
  rvm use ruby-2.7.2@diamant --create
  gem install diamant
#+end_src

Then you need to a generate self-signed TLS certificate and private key. In
the following example, remember to replace the example hostname
~myhostname.com~ by the one you would like to use.

Diamant provides a tool to create these certificate and key:

#+begin_src shell
  diamant generate_tls_cert myhostname.com
#+end_src

You can also use the OpenSSL command if you prefer:

#+begin_src shell
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.rsa -out cert.pem
      -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=myhostname.com"
#+end_src

Finally, you should create a folder to store your static files to serve:

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir public_gmi
  echo 'Hello World!' > public_gmi/index.gmi
#+end_src

* Run the server

With all the default options, runing the server is as simple as:

#+begin_src shell
  diamant
#+end_src

However, you may want to use some other options:

#+begin_src shell
  diamant --public-path ~/my_gemini_site -b 0.0.0.0
#+end_src

To see all possible options, just enter the following command:

#+begin_src shell
  diamant --help
#+end_src
